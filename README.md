# Applied-Data-Science-Project
This project is one of the main parts of the Applied Data Science course by the DataRoadMap group.
It is a prediction project using four different machine-learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, and K Nearest Neighbors.
The project has been defined in one of the projects of the SpaceX Co.
As it is claimed, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch costs about 62 million dollars, while other companies provide this cost for over 165 million dollars. The reason for the extremely low price of Falcon 9 is that the first stage of the lunch can be reused.
In this project, we tried to evaluate how likely the safe landing of the first stage of the Falcon 9 rockets is.
This is a supervised learning ML method.
The data for this project has been scraped from the free data on the SpaceX website and has been preprocessed to be ready to use for the training and testing of ML models.
